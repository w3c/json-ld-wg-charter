# Proposed Charter for a JSON-LD Maintenance Working Group

Any text in this repository should be considered as a draft. The goal is to submit it, at some point, to the W3C Advisory Committee for approval.

The proposed maintenance Working Group should serve as a follow up of the current [JSON-LD 1.1 Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/) whose charer expires in June 2020.

The [properly rendered version](https://w3c.github.io/jsonld-wg-charter/) is also available.
